## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Background

The original RAG pipeline was designed for semantic quote retrieval and structured question answering using the Abirate/english_quotes dataset. The system employed a sentence transformer model (all-MiniLM-L6-v2) for semantic embeddings and FAISS for efficient similarity search. However, the initial implementation had limitations in answer generation quality and retrieval diversity.

### 1.2 Enhancement Objectives

The enhancement project aimed to address these limitations by:

1. **Implementing LLM-based Answer Generation:** Integrating a conversational AI model (microsoft/DialoGPT-small) to generate coherent, contextual responses based on retrieved quotes
2. **Adding BM25 for Hybrid Search:** Incorporating keyword-based retrieval using BM25 algorithm to complement semantic search
3. **Developing Hybrid Retrieval Strategy:** Combining semantic and keyword-based approaches using Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF)
4. **Establishing Comprehensive Evaluation Framework:** Creating a robust assessment methodology to measure system performance

### 1.3 Technical Architecture

The enhanced RAG pipeline consists of several key components:

- **Data Processing Layer:** Preprocessing of quote text, author information, and tags
- **Indexing Layer:** Dual indexing with FAISS for semantic search and BM25 for keyword search
- **Retrieval Layer:** Three retrieval modes (semantic, BM25, hybrid) with configurable parameters
- **Generation Layer:** LLM-powered answer synthesis with fallback to template-based responses
- **Evaluation Layer:** Custom metrics framework for comprehensive performance assessment



## 2. Methodology

### 2.1 Evaluation Framework Design

The evaluation framework was designed to comprehensively assess the enhanced RAG pipeline's performance across multiple dimensions. Given the limitations of accessing external APIs required by the standard RAGAS framework, a custom evaluation methodology was developed that maintains the core principles of RAG assessment while operating entirely within the local environment.

### 2.2 Dataset Creation

A diverse evaluation dataset was constructed containing 30 carefully crafted queries spanning various topics and complexity levels. The queries were designed to test different aspects of the system:

- **Topical Diversity:** Queries covering love, wisdom, success, courage, leadership, creativity, and other themes
- **Query Complexity:** Ranging from simple topic requests to specific author inquiries
- **Linguistic Variation:** Different phrasing patterns and question structures

Example queries include:
- "What are some inspiring quotes about hope and perseverance?"
- "What did famous philosophers say about life and wisdom?"
- "Can you find quotes about creativity and imagination?"

### 2.3 Evaluation Metrics

Five key metrics were implemented to assess different aspects of RAG performance:

#### 2.3.1 Context Relevance
**Definition:** Measures how relevant the retrieved contexts (quotes) are to the input question.  
**Calculation:** Cosine similarity between question embeddings and context embeddings using sentence transformers.  
**Interpretation:** Higher scores indicate better retrieval quality.

#### 2.3.2 Answer Relevance
**Definition:** Assesses how well the generated answer addresses the input question.  
**Calculation:** Cosine similarity between question embeddings and answer embeddings.  
**Interpretation:** Higher scores indicate more relevant and on-topic responses.

#### 2.3.3 Context Precision
**Definition:** Evaluates the precision of retrieved contexts based on retrieval scores.  
**Calculation:** Normalized average of retrieval confidence scores across different methods.  
**Interpretation:** Higher scores indicate more precise retrieval with fewer irrelevant results.

#### 2.3.4 Context Recall
**Definition:** Measures how well the retrieved contexts cover the ground truth information.  
**Calculation:** Maximum cosine similarity between ground truth and retrieved contexts.  
**Interpretation:** Higher scores indicate better coverage of relevant information.

#### 2.3.5 Faithfulness
**Definition:** Assesses how well the generated answer is supported by the retrieved contexts.  
**Calculation:** Average cosine similarity between answer and context embeddings.  
**Interpretation:** Higher scores indicate answers that are more grounded in the provided evidence.

### 2.4 Retrieval Method Comparison

Three retrieval approaches were systematically compared:

1. **Semantic Retrieval:** Pure vector similarity using FAISS index
2. **BM25 Retrieval:** Keyword-based retrieval using BM25 algorithm
3. **Hybrid Retrieval:** Combination using Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF)

### 2.5 Experimental Setup

- **Model Configuration:** 
  - Sentence Transformer: all-MiniLM-L6-v2
  - LLM: microsoft/DialoGPT-small
  - Embedding Dimension: 384
