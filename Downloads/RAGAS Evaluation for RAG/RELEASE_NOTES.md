# Release v1.0.0 - Initial Release

## 🎉 What's New

This is the initial release of the RAG Quote System, a comprehensive Retrieval-Augmented Generation system built entirely with open source models.

### ✨ Features

- **Multiple Retrieval Methods**: Semantic search, BM25, contextual search, and hybrid approaches
- **Open Source LLM**: Microsoft DialoGPT for answer generation
- **Advanced Evaluation**: Custom evaluation framework and RAGAS integration
- **No API Dependencies**: Works completely offline with local models
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Built-in test suite and demo scripts

### 🔧 Technical Details

- **Python**: 3.8+
- **Memory**: 2-4 GB RAM recommended
- **Models**: All open source (no API keys required)
- **Performance**: 0.1-2 seconds per query

### 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run tests
python test_rag_system.py

# Try the demo
python demo_rag_system.py
```

### 📊 System Statistics

- **Total Quotes**: 2,508
- **Retrieval Methods**: 5 (semantic, BM25, contextual, keyword advanced, hybrid)
- **Evaluation Metrics**: 5 (context relevance, answer relevance, precision, recall, faithfulness)

### 🐛 Known Issues

- RAGAS evaluation may fail if models are not properly configured (expected behavior)
- LLM generation may fall back to simple formatting if model loading fails

### 🔮 Future Plans

- Add more evaluation metrics
- Support for additional languages
- Web interface improvements
- Model fine-tuning capabilities
