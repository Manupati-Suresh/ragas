"“Only once in your life, I truly believe, you find someone who can completely turn your world around. You tell them things that youâ€™ve never shared with another soul and they absorb everything you say and actually want to hear more. You share hopes for the future, dreams that will never come true, goals that were never achieved and the many disappointments life has thrown at you. When something wonderful happens, you canâ€™t wait to tell them about it, knowing they will share in your excitement. They are not embarrassed to cry with you when you are hurting or laugh with you when you make a fool of yourself. Never do they hurt your feelings or make you feel like you are not good enough, but rather they build you up and show you the things about yourself that make you special and even beautiful. There is never any pressure, jealousy or competition but only a quiet calmness when they are around. You can be yourself and not worry about what they will think of you because they love you for who you are. The things that seem insignificant to most people such as a note, song or walk become invaluable treasures kept safe in your heart to cherish forever. Memories of your childhood come back and are so clear and vivid itâ€™s like being young again. Colours seem brighter and more brilliant. Laughter seems part of daily life where before it was infrequent or didnâ€™t exist at all. A phone call or two during the day helps to get you through a long dayâ€™s work and always brings a smile to your face. In their presence, thereâ€™s no need for continuous conversation, but you find youâ€™re quite content in just having them nearby. Things that never interested you before become fascinating because you know they are important to this person who is so special to you. You think of this person on every occasion and in everything you do. Simple things bring them to mind like a pale blue sky, gentle wind or even a storm cloud on the horizon. You open your heart knowing that thereâ€™s a chance it may be broken one day and in opening your heart, you experience a love and joy that you never dreamed possible. You find that being vulnerable is the only way to allow your heart to feel true pleasure thatâ€™s so real it scares you. You find strength in knowing you have a true friend and possibly a soul mate who will remain loyal to the end. Life seems completely different, exciting and worthwhile. Your only hope and security is in knowing that they are a part of your life.”",Bob Marley,[],life truly believe find someone completely turn world around tell thing youve never shared another soul absorb everything say actually want hear share hope future dream never come true goal never achieved many disappointment life thrown something wonderful happens cant wait tell knowing share excitement embarrassed cry hurting laugh make fool never hurt feeling make feel like good enough rather build show thing make special even beautiful never pressure jealousy competition quiet calmness around worry think love thing seem insignificant people note song walk become invaluable treasure kept safe heart cherish forever memory childhood come back clear vivid like young colour seem brighter brilliant laughter seems part daily life infrequent didnt exist phone call two day help get long day work always brings smile face presence there need continuous conversation find youre quite content nearby thing never interested become fascinating know important person special think person every occasion everything simple thing bring mind like pale blue sky gentle wind even storm cloud horizon open heart knowing there chance may broken one day opening heart experience love joy never dreamed possible find vulnerable way allow heart feel true pleasure thats real scare find strength knowing true friend possibly soul mate remain loyal end life seems completely different exciting worthwhile hope security knowing part life,bob marley

I believe that California is going to sink into the sea when the big one comes, while Florida is going to dissolve into madness and alligators and toxic waste.

I believe in a personal god who cares about me and worries and oversees everything I do. I believe in an impersonal god who set the universe in motion and went off to hang with her girlfriends and doesn't even know that I'm alive. I believe in an empty and godless universe of causal chaos, background noise, and sheer blind luck. I believe that anyone who says sex is overrated just hasn't done it properly. I believe that anyone who claims to know what's going on will lie about the little things too. I believe in absolute honesty and sensible social lies. I believe in a woman's right to choose, a baby's right to live, that while all human life is sacred there's nothing wrong with the death penalty if you can trust the legal system implicitly, and that no one but a moron would ever trust the legal system.

In other words, loneliness is something I've never been bothered with because I've always had this terrible itch for solitude. It's being at a party, or at a stadium full of people cheering for something, that I might feel loneliness. I'll quote Ibsen, ""The strongest men are the most alone."" I've never thought, ""Well, some beautiful blonde will come in here and give me a fuck-job, rub my balls, and I'll feel good."" No, that won't help. You know the typical crowd, ""Wow, it's Friday night, what are you going to do? Just sit there?"" Well, yeah. Because there's nothing out there. It's stupidity.

We have multiplied our possessions, but reduced our values. We talk too much, love too seldom, and hate too often.We've learned how to make a living, but not a life.

We build more computers to hold more information, to produce more copies than ever, but we communicate less and less.These are the times of fast foods and slow digestion, big men and small character, steep profits and shallow relationships.These are the days of two incomes but more divorce, fancier houses, but broken homes.

"“For me, trees have always been the most penetrating preachers. I revere them when they live in tribes and families, in forests and groves. And even more I revere them when they stand alone. They are like lonely persons. Not like hermits who have stolen away out of some weakness, but like great, solitary men, like Beethoven and Nietzsche. In their highest boughs the world rustles, their roots rest in infinity; but they do not lose themselves there, they struggle with all the force of their lives for one thing only: to fulfil themselves according to their own laws, to build up their own form, to represent themselves. Nothing is holier, nothing is more exemplary than a beautiful, strong tree. When a tree is cut down and reveals its naked death-wound to the sun, one can read its whole history in the luminous, inscribed disk of its trunk: in the rings of its years, its scars, all the struggle, all the suffering, all the sickness, all the happiness and prosperity stand truly written, the narrow years and the luxurious years, the attacks withstood, the storms endured. And every young farmboy knows that the hardest and noblest wood has the narrowest rings, that high on the mountains and in continuing danger the most indestructible, the strongest, the ideal trees grow. Trees are sanctuaries. Whoever knows how to speak to them, whoever knows how to listen to them, can learn the truth. They do not preach learning and precepts, they preach, undeterred by particulars, the ancient law of life. A tree says: A kernel is hidden in me, a spark, a thought, I am life from eternal life. The attempt and the risk that the eternal mother took with me is unique, unique the form and veins of my skin, unique the smallest play of leaves in my branches and the smallest scar on my bark. I was made to form and reveal the eternal in my smallest special detail. A tree says: My strength is trust. I know nothing about my fathers, I know nothing about the thousand children that every year spring out of me. I live out the secret of my seed to the very end, and I care for nothing else. I trust that God is in me. I trust that my labor is holy. Out of this trust I live. When we are stricken and cannot bear our lives any longer, then a tree has something to say to us: Be still! Be still! Look at me! Life is not easy, life is not difficult. Those are childish thoughts. Let God speak within you, and your thoughts will grow silent. You are anxious because your path leads away from mother and home. But every step and every day lead you back again to the mother. Home is neither here nor there. Home is within you, or home is nowhere at all. A longing to wander tears my heart when I hear trees rustling in the wind at evening. If one listens to them silently for a long time, this longing reveals its kernel, its meaning. It is not so much a matter of escaping from one's suffering, though it may seem to be so. It is a longing for home, for a memory of the mother, for new metaphors for life. It leads home. Every path leads homeward, every step is birth, every step is death, every grave is mother. So the tree rustles in the evening, when we stand uneasy before our own childish thoughts: Trees have long thoughts, long-breathing and restful, just as they have longer lives than ours. They are wiser than we are, as long as we do not listen to them. But when we have learned how to listen to trees, then the brevity and the quickness and the childlike hastiness of our thoughts achieve an incomparable joy. Whoever has learned how to listen to trees no longer wants to be a tree. He wants to be nothing except what he is. That is home. That is happiness.”","Herman Hesse,",[],tree always penetrating preacher revere live tribe family forest grove even revere stand alone like lonely person like hermit stolen away weakness like great solitary men like beethoven nietzsche highest bough world rustle root rest infinity lose struggle force life one thing fulfil according law build form represent nothing holier nothing exemplary beautiful strong tree tree cut reveals naked deathwound sun one read whole history luminous inscribed disk trunk ring year scar struggle suffering sickness happiness prosperity stand truly written narrow year luxurious year attack withstood storm endured every young farmboy know hardest noblest wood narrowest ring high mountain continuing danger indestructible strongest ideal tree grow tree sanctuary whoever know speak whoever know listen learn truth preach learning precept preach undeterred particular ancient law life tree say kernel hidden spark thought life eternal life attempt risk eternal mother took unique unique form vein skin unique smallest play leaf branch smallest scar bark made form reveal eternal smallest special detail tree say strength trust know nothing father know nothing thousand child every year spring live secret seed end care nothing else trust god trust labor holy trust live stricken bear life longer tree something say u still still look life easy life difficult childish thought let god speak within thought grow silent anxious path lead away mother home every step every day lead back mother home neither home within home nowhere longing wander tear heart hear tree rustling wind evening one listens silently long time longing reveals kernel meaning much matter escaping one suffering though may seem longing home memory mother new metaphor life lead home every path lead homeward every step birth every step death every grave mother tree rustle evening stand uneasy childish thought tree long thought longbreathing restful longer life wiser long listen learned listen tree brevity quickness childlike hastiness thought achieve incomparable joy whoever learned listen tree longer want tree want nothing except home happiness,herman hesse

And though I have no choice about the one, at least I can choose about the other. I'm leaving you our family ring because you have as much right to it as I do.I'm writing this watching the sun come up. You're asleep, dreams moving behind your restless eyelids. I wish I knew what you were thinking. I wish I could slip into your head and see the world the way you do. I wish I could see myself the way you do. But maybe I dont want to see that. Maybe it would make me feel even more than I already do that I'm perpetuating some kind of Great Lie on you, and I couldn't stand that. I belong to you. You could do anything you wanted with me and I would let you. You could ask anything of me and I'd break myself trying to make you happy. My heart tells me this is the best and greatest feeling I have ever had. But my mind knows the difference between wanting what you can't have and wanting what you shouldn't want. And I shouldn't want you.All night I've watched you sleeping, watched the moonlight come and go, casting its shadows across your face in black and white. I've never seen anything more beautiful. I think of the life we could have had if things were different, a life where this night is not a singular event, separate from everything else that's real, but every night. But things aren't different, and I can't look at you without feeling like I've tricked you into loving me.The truth no one is willing to say out loud is that no one has a shot against Valentine but me. I can get close to him like no one else can. I can pretend I want to join him and he'll believe me, up until that last moment where I end it all, one way or another. I have something of Sebastian's; I can track him to where my father's hiding, and that's what I'm going to do. So I lied to you last night. I said I just wanted one night with you. But I want every night with you. And that's why I have to slip out of your window now, like a coward. Because if I had to tell you this to your face, I couldn't make myself go. I don't blame you if you hate me, I wish you would. As long as I can still dream, I will dream of you. _Jace”","Cassandra Clare,",[],clary despite everything cant bear thought ring lost forever bear thought leaving forever though choice one least choose im leaving family ring much right doim writing watching sun come youre asleep dream moving behind restless eyelid wish knew thinking wish could slip head see world way wish could see way maybe dont want see maybe would make feel even already im perpetuating kind great lie couldnt stand belong could anything wanted would let could ask anything id break trying make happy heart tell best greatest feeling ever mind know difference wanting cant wanting shouldnt want shouldnt want youall night ive watched sleeping watched moonlight come go casting shadow across face black white ive never seen anything beautiful think life could thing different life night singular event separate everything else thats real every night thing arent different cant look without feeling like ive tricked loving methe truth one willing say loud one shot valentine get close like one else pretend want join hell believe last moment end one way another something sebastians track father hiding thats im going lied last night said wanted one night want every night thats slip window like coward tell face couldnt make go dont blame hate wish would long still dream dream jace,cassandra clare

"“Perhaps the greatest faculty our minds possess is the ability to cope with pain. Classic thinking teaches us of the four doors of the mind, which everyone moves through according to their need.First is the door of sleep. Sleep offers us a retreat from the world and all its pain. Sleep marks passing time, giving us distance from the things that have hurt us. When a person is wounded they will often fall unconscious. Similarly, someone who hears traumatic news will often swoon or faint. This is the mind's way of protecting itself from pain by stepping through the first door.Second is the door of forgetting. Some wounds are too deep to heal, or too deep to heal quickly. In addition, many memories are simply painful, and there is no healing to be done. The saying 'time heals all wounds' is false. Time heals most wounds. The rest are hidden behind this door.Third is the door of madness. There are times when the mind is dealt such a blow it hides itself in insanity. While this may not seem beneficial, it is. There are times when reality is nothing but pain, and to escape that pain the mind must leave reality behind. Last is the door of death. The final resort. Nothing can hurt us after we are dead, or so we have been told.”","Patrick Rothfuss,",[],perhaps greatest faculty mind possess ability cope pain classic thinking teach u four door mind everyone move according needfirst door sleep sleep offer u retreat world pain sleep mark passing time giving u distance thing hurt u person wounded often fall unconscious similarly someone hears traumatic news often swoon faint mind way protecting pain stepping first doorsecond door forgetting wound deep heal deep heal quickly addition many memory simply painful healing done saying time heals wound false time heals wound rest hidden behind doorthird door madness time mind dealt blow hide insanity may seem beneficial time reality nothing pain escape pain mind must leave reality behind last door death final resort nothing hurt u dead told,patrick rothfuss

To taste strong spices and hear the songs the sirens sang.

And Iâ€™m going to paint the solar system on the back of her hands so that she has to learn the entire universe before she can say â€œOh, I know that like the back of my hand.â€�Sheâ€™s gonna learn that this life will hit you, hard, in the face, wait for you to get back up so it can kick you in the stomach. But getting the wind knocked out of you is the only way to remind your lungs how much they like the taste of air. There is hurt, here, that cannot be fixed by band-aids or poetry, so the first time she realizes that Wonder-woman isnâ€™t coming, Iâ€™ll make sure she knows she doesnâ€™t have to wear the cape all by herself.

It can crumble so easily but donâ€™t be afraid to stick your tongue out and taste it.â€œBaby,â€� Iâ€™ll tell her â€œremember your mama is a worrier but your papa is a warrior and you are the girl with small hands and big eyes who never stops asking for more.â€�Remember that good things come in threes and so do bad things and always apologize when youâ€™ve done something wrong but donâ€™t you ever apologize for the way your eyes refuse to stop shining.Your voice is small but donâ€™t ever stop singing and when they finally hand you heartbreak, slip hatred and war under your doorstep and hand you hand-outs on street corners of cynicism and defeat, you tell them that they really ought to meet your mother.”",Sarah Kay,[],daughterinstead mom shes gon na call point b way know matter happens least always find way im going paint solar system back hand learn entire universe say oh know like back handshes gon na learn life hit hard face wait get back kick stomach getting wind knocked way remind lung much like taste air hurt fixed bandaids poetry first time realizes wonderwoman isnt coming ill make sure know doesnt wear cape matter wide stretch finger hand always small catch pain want heal believe ive triedand baby ill tell dont keep nose air like know trick youre smelling smoke follow trail back burning house find boy lost everything fire see save else find boy lit fire first place see change himbut know anyway instead ill always keep extra supply chocolate rain boat nearby cause heartbreak chocolate cant fix okay there heartbreak chocolate cant fix thats rain boot rain wash away everything let iti want see world underside glass bottom boat look magnifying glass galaxy exist pin point human mind thats mom taught therell day like therell day like momma said open hand catch wind blister bruise step phone booth try fly people wan na save one standing cape boot fill rain youll knee disappointment day reason say thank cause nothing beautiful way ocean refuse stop kissing shoreline matter many time sent awayyou put wind win lose put star starting matter many land mine erupt minute sure mind land beauty funny place called lifeand yes scale one overtrusting pretty damn naive want know world made sugar crumble easily dont afraid stick tongue taste itbaby ill tell remember mama worrier papa warrior girl small hand big eye never stop asking moreremember good thing come three bad thing always apologize youve done something wrong dont ever apologize way eye refuse stop shiningyour voice small dont ever stop singing finally hand heartbreak slip hatred war doorstep hand handout street corner cynicism defeat tell really ought meet mother,sarah kay
